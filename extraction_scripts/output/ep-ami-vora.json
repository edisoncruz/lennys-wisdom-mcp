  "title": "Fascinating: Curiosity, Metaphors, and Execution at Scale",
  "description": "Ami Vora, Chief Product Officer at Faire and former head of product for Facebook Ads and WhatsApp at Meta, shares lessons on building product strategy, disagreeing with conviction, scaling teams through metaphors and narrative, and why execution beats strategy every time.",
  "summary": "Ami discusses how curiosity and genuine openness to disagreement transformed her leadership, the power of metaphors (dinosaur brain, hill climb, putting on the coat of the job) to align teams and make decisions, why execution matters more than perfect strategy, how to set up effective product reviews, and navigating her path from temp at Facebook to leading products at scale. She emphasizes the importance of talking to customers, building complementary teams, and being authentic about the messy reality of leadership.",
