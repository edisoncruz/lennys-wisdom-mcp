  "summary": "Dan discusses Every's AI-first operating model: hiring an AI operations lead to automate workflows, compounding engineering (each unit of work makes the next easier), no engineers writing code manually, his AI tool stack (o3 for memory, Claude Opus 4 for judgment), and hot takes including why AI may reshore American jobs and his definition of AGI (when agents run indefinitely profitably).",
