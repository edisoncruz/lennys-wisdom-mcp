  "title": "Thinking in Bets: Decision-Making Under Uncertainty and the Power of Knowing When to Quit",
  "description": "Annie Duke, former poker champion and decision-making expert, shares frameworks for improving decision quality through explicit reasoning, probabilistic thinking, and structured decision processes. Covers resulting vs. process evaluation, pre-mortems with kill criteria, and the psychology of quitting.",
  "summary": "Annie Duke discusses how to improve decision-making by making implicit assumptions explicit, the critical difference between decision quality and outcomes (resulting), how to shorten feedback loops by identifying correlated signals, the importance of independent discovery before group discussion, pre-mortems with actionable kill criteria, and why people consistently quit too late due to sunk cost bias and identity concerns.",
