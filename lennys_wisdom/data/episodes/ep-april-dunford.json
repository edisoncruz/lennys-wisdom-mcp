  "description": "April Dunford, bestselling author of Obviously Awesome and positioning expert, shares her methodology for nailing product positioning. Learn how to identify competitive alternatives, find differentiated value, target best-fit customers, and craft market-winning strategies that resonate with buyers.",
  "summary": "April explains positioning as defining how your product is the best solution for a specific set of companies who care about your unique value. She breaks down the 5-step framework: identify competitive alternatives (including status quo), determine differentiated capabilities, translate to value, identify target customers, and define market category. She emphasizes that weak positioning impacts the entire sales pipeline, from initial interest to post-sale churn. Good positioning feels obvious to the right buyer and requires alignment across marketing, product, sales, and customer success.",
