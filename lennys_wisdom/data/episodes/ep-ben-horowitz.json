  "description": "Ben Horowitz, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, shares lessons on CEO decision-making under pressure, why hesitation is deadly, the Good Product Manager framework, managerial leverage, not judging people by worst moments, and why AI isn't a bubble.",
  "summary": "Ben discusses success as a series of small good decisions (pilot story), running towards fear because hesitation locks up companies, making unpopular decisions (only value CEOs add), Good Product Manager as leadership not tasks, managerial leverage (team tells you what to do), not judging people on worst moments (Adam Neumann), confidence being critical for founders, and why AI isn't a financial bubble unlike dot-com.",
