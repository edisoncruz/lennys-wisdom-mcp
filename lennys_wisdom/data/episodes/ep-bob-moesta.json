  "title": "The Jobs to Be Done Framework with Bob Moesta",
  "description": "Bob Moesta, co-creator of the Jobs to Be Done framework alongside Clay Christensen, explores how to understand why customers truly hire products, the four forces of progress, customer interview methodology, and how to apply jobs thinking to product innovation.",
  "summary": "Bob Moesta breaks down the Jobs to Be Done framework, explaining that customers hire products to make progress in their lives, not buy features. He discusses the four forces (push, pull, anxiety, habit), the importance of understanding context over pain points, interview techniques based on criminal interrogation methods, why struggling moments precede all demand, and how to identify true competitors through customer job analysis rather than supply-side product comparison.",
