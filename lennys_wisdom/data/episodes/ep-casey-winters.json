  "description": "Casey Winters, CPO at Eventbrite and former Pinterest growth leader, shares frameworks for upward communication, perceived simplicity in products, justifying non-sexy work, kindle vs fire growth strategies, and the spectrum of product people from innovators to executors.",
  "summary": "Casey discusses how to communicate upward by starting at the right chapter of the story, building perceived simplicity (WhatsApp model), justifying investments in stability/performance, kindle strategies (non-scalable hacks) vs fire strategies (scalable loops), why product ops should eliminate inefficiency not normalize it, the CPO role as company-first optimization, and developing strategic thinking in executional PMs.",
