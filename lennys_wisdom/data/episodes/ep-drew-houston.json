  "title": "The Three Eras of Dropbox: From Viral Growth to Strategic Reckoning",
  "description": "Drew Houston, CEO and co-founder of Dropbox, shares his 18-year journey building the company through three distinct eras: explosive viral growth, competitive siege from giants, and strategic reinvention. He discusses navigating product-led growth, company culture transformation, leadership challenges, and the painful lessons learned during Dropbox's pivot from diversified products to focused productivity.",
  "summary": "Drew Houston reveals the real story behind Dropbox's rise and near-demise. Starting from explosive viral growth powered by virality mechanics and referral loops, Dropbox faced existential threats from Apple, Google, and Microsoft entering the market. Rather than blame external competition, Houston takes accountability for self-inflicted wounds—overexpansion into Carousel, Mailbox, and consumer products. He shares how he used books like 'Playing to Win' and 'Only the Paranoid Survive' to make the painful decision to kill products and go all-in on productivity. The journey required deep personal work through meditation, coaching, and the Enneagram to understand his leadership blind spots. Now in chapter three, Dropbox is reinventing itself around distributed work and unified information access, with new products like Dash solving the fragmentation problem Houston identified.",
