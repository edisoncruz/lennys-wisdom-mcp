  "description": "Shreyas Doshi, former product leader at Stripe, Twitter, Google, and Yahoo, shares five transformative frameworks for product management: pre-mortems to avoid ugly post-mortems, LNO for prioritizing your time, three levels of product work, why execution problems are strategy problems, and the power of high agency.",
  "summary": "Shreyas deep-dives into five big product management ideas: (1) pre-mortems using tigers/paper tigers/elephants to identify risks before launch, (2) LNO framework (Leverage/Neutral/Overhead tasks) for time management, (3) three levels of product work (Impact/Execution/Optics) and why misalignment causes conflict, (4) most execution problems are actually strategy or culture problems, (5) minimize opportunity cost instead of maximizing ROI, plus bonus on high agency.",
